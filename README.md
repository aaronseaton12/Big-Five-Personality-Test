# Big-Five-Personality-Test
_An Android app that tests your personality traits using the 50-item IPIP version of the Big Five Markers_

The assignment for Project 3 of the Google Android Basics Nanodegree by Udacity was to create a quiz app. I wanted to 
make it interesting again, so I decided to make a personality quiz using real world methodology. After a bit of searching
I decided to implement a personality test for the [Big Five Markers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits). 
A cursory search led me to the IPIP and their open source IPIP questions and scales, and I ended up recreating the title, 
instructions and questions from [this page](http://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-50-item-scale.htm) in order to keep the scoring accurate.

In order to show the results of the test I used a [GraphView](https://github.com/appsthatmatter/GraphView) so thanks to @appsthatmatter
for that functionality. 

**Please try out the app and report any bugs.**

**Features I'd like to implement:** Please see the [Issues section](https://github.com/adriantache/Big-Five-Personality-Test/issues)

**Known issues:**
* app is using hardcoded strings â€“ won't fix, as translating the app would probably skew the results due to using translations that
have not been tested by a psychologist
~~* app looks weird on small DPIs (<xxhdpi) or large text sizes (>small)~~
